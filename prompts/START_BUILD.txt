You are Claude/Codex working inside the repo "asset-bundler" (public). Keep branding generic.

Goal:
- A GitHub Actions cron worker that polls a Core API for IMAGE_PROCESS jobs, transforms images, uploads outputs to Cloudflare R2, and calls back job completion.

Requirements:
- Node.js + TypeScript
- Use sharp for image transforms
- Use AWS SDK S3 client configured for Cloudflare R2
- Runs every minute (cron)
- Never log secrets

Protocol:
- GET {CORE_BASE_URL}/jobs/next?type=IMAGE_PROCESS&limit=2 with header X-WORKER-TOKEN
- Response items include:
  { job_id, design_version_id, source_download_url, upload_prefix, callback_complete_url }
- Download source image from source_download_url
- Generate:
  - print/shirt.png (4500x5400) after trimming transparency
  - print/sticker.png (2800x2800)
  - print/hat.png (2400x2400)
- Write manifest.json with dimensions + file sizes
- Upload to R2 under upload_prefix (e.g. bundles/{design_version_id}/...)
- POST callback_complete_url with header X-WORKER-TOKEN and JSON body:
  { bundle_prefix, manifest_json }

Deliverables:
- .github/workflows/worker.yml
- src/worker.ts, src/image.ts, src/r2.ts
- docs/SECRETS.md listing:
  CORE_BASE_URL, WORKER_TOKEN, R2_ACCOUNT_ID, R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID, R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, R2_BUCKET
- package.json scripts: build, lint, start, run

Output full code with filenames.
