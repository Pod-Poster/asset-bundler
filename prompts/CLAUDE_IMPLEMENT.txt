You are Claude. Implement a small fix in this repo (asset-bundler).
Do not modify docs/SMOKETEST_LOG.md if it already contains Status: PASS.

Goal:
Fix the success callback to Core (/jobs/:id/complete) so it includes manifest in result.

Requirements:
1) File: src/worker.ts
   Find where manifest is created (generateManifest(outputs)).
   Ensure the success callback payload includes:
   {
     success: true,
     result: { bundle_prefix: job.upload_prefix, manifest }
   }

2) Also send a failure callback (recommended):
   {
     success: false,
     error: <string>
   }
   Do not let callback failures crash the whole worker.

3) The build must pass:
   npm run build (tsc)

Deliverables:
- Commit-ready code changes
- Brief summary of what changed and where
