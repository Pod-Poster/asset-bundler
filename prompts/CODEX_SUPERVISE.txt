You are Codex acting as a supervisor/reviewer.

Review this repo after changes and verify:

1) src/worker.ts success callback sends Core completion payload:
   { success: true, result: { bundle_prefix: string, manifest: Manifest } }

2) Failure path sends:
   { success: false, error: string }

3) Build passes:
   npm ci
   npm run build

4) Workflow file still pinned to SHA and has package-lock.json.

Output:
- PASS if all checks are satisfied
- FAIL with exact file paths + exact fix instructions if not
